Q1)What are the limitations of CSS ?
    
Limitations of CSS : -

1)Global Definition: In CSS, there is no option to declare a variable for use globally. This can lead to repetition of code and increased file size.

2)Cross-Browser Issues: Different browsers can interpret CSS differently, leading to inconsistencies in the appearance of web pages.

3)Control Limitations: CSS has limited control over the appearance of elements, especially when compared to languages like JavaScript. For example, it cannot control the behavior of an element when a user interacts with it.

4)No Expressions: CSS does not support the use of expressions that can dynamically set the values of styling properties.

5)Lack of Functions: CSS lacks the ability to create functions or methods, which can limit the reusability of code.

Q2)How many ways can a CSS be integrated as a web page?

We have Three ways : - 

1)Inline CSS: CSS rules are applied directly within the HTML tags using the style attribute.

2)Internal CSS: CSS rules are included in the <head> section of the HTML file within <style> tags.

3)External CSS: CSS rules are written in a separate file with a .css extension, which is linked to the HTML file using the <link> tag.
