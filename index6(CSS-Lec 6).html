Q1) What are the differences between the opacity property and alpha channel in rgba or hsla?

The opacity property affects the whole element and its children,while the alpha channel only affects the specific property that uses it.
Another difference is that the opacity property can be animated, while the alpha channel cannot.

Q2)What is the most effective method for setting CSS color properties?

There is many setting CSS color properties, as different methods have different advantages and disadvantages.
However, some general guidelines are to use HEX values for simple colors, RGB or RGBA values for colors with transparency,
HSL or HSLA values for colors with hue, saturation, or lightness adjustments, CSS custom properties for colors that need to be reused or changed,
color keywords for common and standard colors, and color-scheme property for elements that need to adapt to the operating system’s color scheme.
